The following CSS rule causes unexpected behavior in some browsers:

```css
div {
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
}
```

This calculation might not be correctly handled, especially when the parent element's width is not explicitly defined or is dynamic.  Some browsers may calculate the 50% before subtracting the 10px leading to incorrect widths.
